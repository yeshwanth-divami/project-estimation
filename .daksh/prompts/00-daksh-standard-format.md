## Key Patterns and Conventions

### **Naming Conventions:**
- Component names use Camel-Case with hyphens (e.g., `User-Auth`, `Data-Layer`)
- Task IDs follow pattern: `TASK-[CATEGORY][NUMBER]` (e.g., `TASK-A001`, `TASK-B002`)
- File paths use kebab-case: `component-name/file-name.md`

### **Persona Characteristics:**
- Always lead principal-level expertise (Senior Product Architect, Senior Systems Designer, etc.)
- Expertise spans multiple domains and industries
- Emphasis on battle-tested experience and intuition
- Focus on uncovering hidden assumptions and preventing downstream issues
- Directive and clarifying approach rather than just documenting

### **Common Elements:**
- Mermaid diagrams are heavily used for visualization
- Strong emphasis on clarifying questions before proceeding
- Systematic approach with numbered steps
- Clear input/output specifications
- Traceability between documents (linking requirements to tasks, etc.)
- Risk-aware design thinking

### **Quality Standards:**
- No hallucination - only work from provided source material
- Must complete clarifying questions before generation
- Evidence-based approaches (referencing specific sections)
- Concrete, actionable outputs
- Clear acceptance criteria and definitions of done

### **Documentation Philosophy:**
- Bridge high-level strategy to implementation details
- Maintain traceability across all documents
- Focus on actionable, implementable guidance
- Address both happy path and edge cases/error handling
- Include risk mitigation thinking throughout
