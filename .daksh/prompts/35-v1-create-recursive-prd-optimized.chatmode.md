# 🚀 Practical Recursive Project Decomposition Framework

*(Cutting the fluff, keeping the essentials)*

## 🌟 Core Principles

* **Independent submodules**: Each submodule is a self-contained mini-project.
* **Clear boundaries**: Define APIs/contracts between submodules early.
* **Minimal process overhead**: Only add structure where it reduces confusion.
* **Iterative checkpoints**: A few key review gates, not endless stop points.

## 🏗️ Directory Structure (Simplified)

```
{project-root}/
├── vision.md                # Overall vision
├── requirements.md          # High-level business requirements
├── architecture.md          # Submodule map + dependencies
├── submodules/
│   ├── {submodule-1}/
│   │   ├── vision.md
│   │   ├── requirements.md
│   │   ├── specs.md
│   │   ├── epics.md
│   │   └── tasks.md
│   └── {submodule-2}/
│       └── [same structure]
└── shared/
    ├── api-contracts/
    └── models/
```

*(No 6 layers of nested `docs/technical-specs/` clutter. Just one file per concern.)*

## 🔄 Process Flow

1. **Project Context**

   * What problem are we solving? Who for? At what scale?

2. **Submodule Split**

   * Split by domain (preferred) or by layer.
   * Rule of thumb: if a team can own and deploy it, it’s a submodule.

3. **Documentation Sequence (Recursive)**

   * For each submodule → `vision → requirements → specs → epics → tasks`.
   * Stop after each stage for quick team validation, not bureaucratic approval.

4. **Integration Contracts**

   * Define **API + data models** for cross-submodule comms.
   * Version them properly.

5. **Independence Check**

   * Can this submodule be developed, tested, and deployed on its own?
   * If no → refactor boundaries.

## ✅ Review Gates (Only 3)

1. **Submodule Boundaries Approved** → everyone agrees on split + dependencies.
2. **Architecture Approved** → teams agree on APIs + tech stack choices.
3. **Release Ready** → docs + tests are in place, submodule is independently shippable.

## 📋 Lightweight submodule README Template

```markdown
# {Submodule Name}

## Domain
Short description of the business problem this solves.

## Dependencies
- Consumes: [links to contracts/APIs]
- Provides: [links to contracts/APIs]

## Tech
- Stack: {tech choices}
- Setup: `{commands}`
- Tests: `{commands}`

## Docs
- [Vision](vision.md)
- [Requirements](requirements.md)
- [Specs](specs.md)
- [Epics](epics.md)
- [Tasks](tasks.md)
```

---

## 🛡️ Guardrails

* No circular dependencies.
* No shared databases without ownership.
* Every API change = version bump.
* Submodules deployable and testable in isolation.

---

## 📈 Success Metric

If a **new engineer can join a submodule and ship value within a week** without reading the entire project → ✅ the framework works.

This version gives you:

* **Clarity without bureaucracy**
* **Independence without folder hell**
* **Just enough checkpoints** to avoid chaos
