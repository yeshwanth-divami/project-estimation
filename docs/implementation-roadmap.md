# Implementation Roadmap

## 1. Executive Summary
- **Philosophy:** Vertical slice development with continuous validation
- **Approach:** Organic growth across all system layers simultaneously
- **Delivery Model:** Hybrid iterative with 2-week sprints and weekly validation gates
- **Success Metrics:** Feature completeness, user task completion time, calculation accuracy

## 2. Development Principles

### Core Tenets
1. **Vertical Slicing:** Every iteration delivers working functionality across all layers
2. **Concurrent Growth:** CSV parsing, business logic, and interface evolve together
3. **Continuous Validation:** Each step includes feedback mechanisms proving value
4. **Dependency Awareness:** Sequence respects both technical and value dependencies
5. **Risk Mitigation:** High-risk elements validated early through thin slices

### Quality Attributes (Woven Throughout)
- **Performance:** Sub-second calculation response times for configurations up to 50 roles
- **Scalability:** Handle rate cards with 200+ roles without UI degradation
- **Security:** Client-side only, no data transmission beyond user's browser
- **Resilience:** Graceful error handling for malformed CSV data and invalid inputs
