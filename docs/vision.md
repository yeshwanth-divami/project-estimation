# Product Vision â€“ Sankalpa

## ðŸš€ 1. Vision Statement
Sankalpa empowers anyone to quickly and simply estimate software project effort by selecting roles and allocating time, removing complexity and enabling fast, informed decisions. The platform is designed for general purpose use, focusing on ease and speed rather than methodology or deep analytics.

## ðŸ‘¤ 2. Target Users / Personas
- **General Purpose User:** Anyone needing a quick project estimate, regardless of background or role.
- **Project Managers / Founders / Sales Teams / Engineering Leads:** Users who want a fast, role-based estimation tool without the overhead of detailed task breakdowns.

These users benefit by saving time, reducing ambiguity, and gaining a clear starting point for project planning.

## ðŸ§© 3. Problem Statements
- **Problem 1:** Estimation processes are often complex, slow, and require detailed breakdowns, making them inaccessible for quick decision-making.
- **Problem 2:** Existing tools are typically tied to specific methodologies or require integration with other systems, limiting flexibility and adoption.

Risks & Challenges: Potential for oversimplification, risk of inaccurate estimates if used for complex projects, and user adoption may be limited if advanced features are expected.

## ðŸŒŸ 4. Core Features / Capabilities
- **Role Selection:** Users can select from a list of typical software project roles.
- **Time Allocation:** Users specify approximate time for each selected role.
- **Estimate Generation:** Platform produces a simple, clear project estimate based on inputs.

Primary features: Role selection, time input, estimate output. Secondary features (future): Cost calculation, saving/sharing estimates.

## ðŸŽ¯ 5. Business Goals / Success Metrics
- No specific KPIs defined yet. Success will be measured by user adoption, feedback, and utility in real-world estimation scenarios.

## ðŸ”­ 6. Scope & Boundaries
**In Scope:**
- Role selection and time estimation (MVP)
- Simple, fast estimate generation

**Out of Scope:**
- Integration with project management tools
- Advanced analytics, custom workflows, deep integrations

## ðŸ“… 7. Timeline / Milestones
- No fixed timeline; deliver when ready.
- Milestones may be defined as the product evolves, focusing first on MVP delivery.

## ðŸ“Œ 8. Strategic Differentiators
- **Simplicity and Ease of Use:** Minimal input required, fast results, no learning curve.
- **General Purpose:** Not tied to any methodology, suitable for a wide range of users and scenarios.
