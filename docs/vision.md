# Vision

## ðŸš€ 1. Vision Statement
Kaushalya empowers service business owners and project managers to quickly calculate team configuration costs, analyze EBITDA profit margins, and determine optimal client quotes through rapid scenario comparison. The platform transforms complex financial planning into simple, visual decision-making for maximum profitability.

## ðŸ‘¤ 2. Target Users / Personas
- **Service Business Owners:** CEOs and founders who need to quickly assess project profitability and set competitive pricing.
- **Project Managers / Sales Teams:** Professionals who need to evaluate multiple team configurations and apply discounts while maintaining target profit margins.
- **Engineering Leads / Delivery Managers:** Technical leaders who want to optimize team composition for both cost efficiency and delivery capability.

These users benefit by making data-driven pricing decisions, maximizing profit margins, and reducing the time spent on manual financial calculations and scenario planning.

## ðŸ§© 3. Problem Statements
- **Problem 1:** Service businesses struggle to quickly calculate true project costs and profit margins, leading to underpricing or lost deals due to slow pricing processes.
- **Problem 2:** Comparing multiple team configurations and discount scenarios manually is time-consuming and error-prone, preventing optimal decision-making.
- **Problem 3:** Sales teams lack visibility into how discounts impact profitability, often making pricing decisions without understanding margin implications.

Risks & Challenges: Accuracy depends on reliable cost data in CSV files, risk of oversimplification for complex projects with variable costs, and potential resistance to data-driven pricing if teams are used to intuitive pricing methods.

## ðŸŒŸ 4. Core Features / Capabilities
- **Team Configuration Builder:** Select roles from CSV-imported rate cards and specify time allocation for each team member.
- **Multi-Configuration Comparison:** Compare up to 3 team configurations side-by-side with costs and profit margins.
- **EBITDA Profit Analysis:** Real-time calculation of profit margins based on internal costs vs. potential revenue.
- **Flexible Discount Engine:** Apply various discount types (percentage, fixed amount, volume-based) and see immediate profit impact.
- **Save & Share Configurations:** Save preferred configurations and share multiple scenarios with stakeholders.

**Major Features:** Cost calculation, profit analysis, scenario comparison
**Primary Features:** Role selection, time allocation, discount application
**Secondary Features:** Configuration saving, sharing, CSV import management

## ðŸŽ¯ 5. Business Goals / Success Metrics
- **Pricing Speed:** Reduce time to generate project quotes from hours to minutes (<5 minutes per configuration).
- **Profit Optimization:** Enable 15-25% improvement in profit margins through better configuration analysis.
- **Decision Confidence:** 90% of users report increased confidence in pricing decisions.
- **Adoption Rate:** Regular use by sales and project teams for all client proposals.

**KPIs:** Quote generation time, profit margin improvements, user adoption rates, configuration comparison frequency.

## ðŸ”­ 6. Scope & Boundaries
**In Scope:**
- CSV-based rate card import and management (MVP)
- Team configuration builder with cost calculation
- EBITDA profit margin analysis
- Multi-configuration comparison (up to 3 initially)
- Flexible discount application with profit impact
- Configuration saving and sharing capabilities

**Out of Scope:**
- Overhead cost calculations (future backlog item)
- Integration with accounting or project management systems
- Time tracking or actual vs. estimated reporting
- Advanced analytics or historical trend analysis
- Multi-currency support (initially)

## ðŸ“… 7. Timeline / Milestones
- **Milestone 1 (MVP):** CSV import, basic configuration builder, single configuration cost calculation
- **Milestone 2:** Multi-configuration comparison, profit margin analysis, basic discount application
- **Milestone 3:** Save/share functionality, advanced discount types, UI polish

**Reasoning:** Prioritizes core financial calculation functionality first, then comparison capabilities, finally collaboration features. Each milestone delivers immediate value while building toward the complete vision.

**Constraints:** Development resource availability, CSV data structure standardization, user feedback integration cycles. Timeline remains flexible based on user validation and technical implementation complexity.

## ðŸ“Œ 8. Strategic Differentiators
- **Profit-First Approach:** Unlike estimation tools that focus on effort, Kaushalya prioritizes financial outcomes and profit optimization.
- **Rapid Scenario Comparison:** Unique ability to quickly compare multiple team configurations with real-time profit impact analysis.
- **Flexible Discount Modeling:** Comprehensive discount engine that shows immediate impact on margins, enabling confident pricing decisions.
- **CSV-Driven Simplicity:** No complex setup or integrations - just import your rates and start optimizing configurations immediately.

**Why:** Most tools focus on project management or time estimation; Kaushalya focuses specifically on financial decision-making for service businesses.
**How:** By combining cost data with visual configuration builders and real-time profit calculations, making complex financial analysis accessible to non-financial users.
