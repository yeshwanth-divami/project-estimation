## 4. Business Rules

### BR-001: File Upload Constraints
- Only CSV files are accepted (.csv extension)
- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Files must contain at minimum: role name and rate columns

### BR-002: Role Data Requirements
- Role names must be non-empty strings
- Hourly rates must be positive numbers
- Duplicate role names are allowed but distinguished by rate

### BR-003: Cost Calculation Rules
- Each selected role contributes its hourly rate to total cost
- Phase 1 assumes 1 hour allocation per selected role
- Total cost is sum of all selected role rates
- Calculations round to 2 decimal places

### BR-004: Display Standards
- Currency displayed with $ symbol
- Numbers formatted with commas for thousands
- Rates shown as "per hour" or "/hr"

## 5. User Experience Requirements
