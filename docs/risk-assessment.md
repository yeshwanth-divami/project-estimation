## Risk Categories & Priority Matrix

### ðŸ”´ HIGH RISK (Immediate Attention Required)

#### 1. **Learning Curve Risk** - Impact: High, Probability: Medium
**Description:** Team learning Svelte while building production app could impact delivery timeline and code quality.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Allocate dedicated time for Svelte learning before development starts
- Build a simple prototype first to validate approach
- Have senior developer do initial architecture setup
- Plan for timeline buffer in MVP phase

#### 2. **User Adoption Risk** - Impact: High, Probability: Medium
**Description:** Target users (service business owners) may resist adopting new financial tools or prefer existing Excel-based workflows.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Conduct user interviews with 5-10 target businesses before development
- Create Excel import/export compatibility
- Design onboarding flow for <5 minutes first success
- Develop comparison demos showing time savings vs. Excel

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM RISK (Monitor & Plan)

#### 3. **CSV Data Quality Risk** - Impact: Medium, Probability: High
**Description:** Users will provide inconsistent, incomplete, or incorrectly formatted CSV rate card data.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Build robust CSV validation with clear error messages
- Provide CSV template download with examples
- Create data cleaning suggestions (duplicate detection, format fixing)
- Add data preview step before import confirmation

#### 4. **Financial Calculation Accuracy Risk** - Impact: High, Probability: Low
**Description:** Errors in EBITDA margin calculations could lead to incorrect business decisions.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement comprehensive unit tests for all calculation functions
- Add calculation audit trail/breakdown views
- Use decimal.js or similar for precise financial calculations
- Include calculation formula explanations in UI

#### 5. **Browser Compatibility Risk** - Impact: Medium, Probability: Medium
**Description:** Local storage limitations and browser differences could affect user experience.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Test across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Implement storage quota detection and warnings
- Add export/backup functionality as fallback
- Consider progressive web app (PWA) features

#### 6. **Performance Risk** - Impact: Medium, Probability: Low
**Description:** Real-time calculations with 20+ roles might exceed 100ms requirement.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Use Svelte's reactive optimization advantages
- Implement calculation debouncing for rapid user input
- Add performance monitoring and alerts
- Consider web workers for heavy calculations if needed

### ðŸŸ¢ LOW RISK (Monitor Only)

#### 7. **Infrastructure Scaling Risk** - Impact: Low, Probability: Low
**Description:** Single EC2 instance may not handle growth beyond initial user base.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Monitor usage metrics from launch
- Design stateless backend for easy horizontal scaling
- Plan migration path to multi-instance setup
- Use CDN for static assets

#### 8. **Technology Obsolescence Risk** - Impact: Low, Probability: Low
**Description:** Chosen tech stack becoming outdated or unsupported.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- All chosen technologies have strong community support
- Regular dependency updates planned
- Modern stack with good migration paths

## Technical Risk Analysis

### Frontend (SvelteKit) Risks:
- **Learning curve:** Mitigated by Svelte's simplicity
- **Ecosystem maturity:** Adequate for project needs
- **Performance:** Excellent for real-time calculations
- **Maintainability:** Clean, readable code structure

### Backend (FastAPI + SQLModel) Risks:
- **Maturity:** Well-established, stable stack
- **Performance:** Excellent for API requirements
- **Scalability:** Good horizontal scaling options
- **Development speed:** Rapid prototyping capabilities

### Database (PostgreSQL) Risks:
- **Reliability:** Industry-standard, battle-tested
- **Scaling:** Good vertical and horizontal options
- **Backup/Recovery:** Well-established procedures

## Business Risk Analysis

### Market Risks:
- **Competition:** Few direct competitors in this specific niche
- **Market size:** Service businesses represent large addressable market
- **Timing:** Economic pressures increase focus on profit optimization

### Product Risks:
- **Feature scope creep:** Well-defined MVP scope limits this risk
- **User experience:** Simple UI requirements reduce complexity
- **Value proposition:** Clear ROI through time savings and profit optimization

## Risk Mitigation Timeline

### Pre-Development Phase:
- [ ] Conduct 5 user interviews
- [ ] Complete Svelte learning/prototyping
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Create CSV template and validation rules

### MVP Development Phase:
- [ ] Implement core calculation engine with tests
- [ ] Build robust CSV import with validation
- [ ] Create user onboarding flow
- [ ] Conduct weekly user testing sessions

### Post-MVP Phase:
- [ ] Monitor user adoption metrics
- [ ] Gather feedback for iteration
- [ ] Plan scaling if needed
- [ ] Document lessons learned

## Success Metrics & Risk Indicators

### Green Flags (Low Risk):
- Users complete first configuration within 5 minutes
- Calculation accuracy validated through testing
- Positive user feedback on time savings
- System handles target load without performance issues

### Red Flags (High Risk):
- Users abandon during CSV import process
- Calculation errors discovered in production
- Performance degrades below 100ms requirement
- Negative user feedback on complexity

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize user validation early** - Risk mitigation through user feedback
2. **Invest in robust testing** - Prevent calculation accuracy issues
3. **Plan conservative timeline** - Account for Svelte learning curve
4. **Focus on CSV UX** - Critical user success factor
5. **Monitor performance closely** - Key differentiator vs. Excel

## Overall Risk Assessment: **MODERATE**

The project has a solid technical foundation with manageable risks. The choice of Svelte adds learning curve risk but provides performance benefits that align well with project requirements. Success depends primarily on user adoption and execution quality rather than technical feasibility.
